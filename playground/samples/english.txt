Natural Language Processing is a significant branch of artificial intelligence. It studies various theories and methods for effective communication between humans and computers using natural language.

NLP is an interdisciplinary field that combines linguistics, computer science, and mathematics. Its applications are extensive, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, text classification, and more.

Early systems relied heavily on rule-based approaches, while modern NLP leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques for tasks like language modeling, text generation, and question answering.
